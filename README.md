**Description**

- The original MUSC 320 project is a music composition tool that allows composers to play a variety of instruments using a MIDI keyboard. Notes can be recorded and played back with full control over parameters such as pitch, octave, duration, and tempo. The tool also includes processing for volume and panning, enabling anyone to become a one-person ensemble.
- For MUSC 420, the project was expanded with a Unity component featuring emissive colors and particle systems, supporting multiple keyboards. The audio suite was enhanced with new instruments, background audio, and toggleable FX such as reverb and chorus. Additionally, users can now save presets for all project controls and record notes with different durations for playback.

**Setup**

- Open "Max.maxproj" -> "Composition Studio.maxpat"
